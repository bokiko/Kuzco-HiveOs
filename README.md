## üìñ Introduction

### What is Kuzco?

Kuzco Testnet is a distributed network where GPU owners can contribute their computing power to run AI inference tasks for large language models like Llama3, Mistral, and others. As a testnet operator, you can earn $KZO points by connecting your GPUs to the network. The earning potential scales with the number of GPUs you contribute.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

Kuzco Testnet is in early development. Expect occasional bugs and downtime periods. The team actively communicates updates through the Operator Discord. While not yet production-ready, the network is continuously being improved and enhanced.

For bug reports or issues, please open a ticket in Discord with detailed information. Stay updated about network status through the Discord announcements channel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### 1. Update System & Install Required Packages
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update

# Install tmux if not already installed
sudo apt install -y tmux
```

### 2. Install Docker
```bash
# Install Docker
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### 3. Create Kuzco Account
1. Visit [kuzco.xyz/register](https://kuzco.xyz/register)
2. Create your account and verify email
3. Connect your Discord account
4. Navigate to "Workers" tab
5. Click "Create Worker" and save your worker ID and code

### 4. Start Your Worker

Create a new tmux session:
```bash
tmux new -s kuzco0
```

Inside the tmux session, run your worker:
```bash
docker run --restart=always --runtime=nvidia --gpus "device=0" \
    -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models \
    -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models \
    kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker \
    --worker YOUR_WORKER_ID \
    --code YOUR_CODE
```

To detach from tmux: Press `Ctrl+B`, then `D`

## üîÑ Multiple GPU Setup

For each additional GPU:

1. Create new worker on Kuzco website
2. Create new tmux session:
```bash
tmux new -s kuzco1  # Use kuzco2 for third GPU, etc.
```
3. Run worker with different device number:
```bash
docker run --restart=always --runtime=nvidia --gpus "device=1" \
    -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models \
    -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models \
    kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker \
    --worker YOUR_WORKER_ID \
    --code YOUR_CODE
```

## üìä Monitoring Commands

### Basic Commands
```bash
# List tmux sessions
tmux ls

# List running containers
docker ps

# Check GPU status
nvidia-smi

# Reattach to tmux session
tmux attach -t kuzco0
```

## ‚ö° Mining Compatibility

### Important Guidelines
- Wait for worker initialization (up to 10 minutes)
- Monitor temperatures closely
- Not recommended with KawPoW or intensive algorithms
- Test stability before mining alongside workers
- Monitor power consumption carefully

### Best Practices
- Initialize one GPU at a time
- Monitor your rig's stability
- Keep track of power consumption
- Ensure proper cooling
- Back up your worker credentials
